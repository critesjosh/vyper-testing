# It might be easier to write the Vyper contract at vyper.online to 
# get syntax highlighting and easier compliation

#
# Events must be declared at the top of the file

# State variables

# With no fallback function specified, a fallback is automatically generated that will revert any transaction that it processes. This is not the case in Solidity.
